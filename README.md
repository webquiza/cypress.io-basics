# _Test automation with Cypress_

#### _[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/ target="_blank") is an open-source test framework that allows writing automated tests in an easy, quick and reliable way, all in JavaScript. This project was created to follow along with this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/test-automation-with-cypress-basic/), which guides you through the basics of test automation using Cypress._

## Technologies Used

* _Cypress_
* _JavaScript_
* _Git_

#### _Follow the setup requirements below if you want to look at how the [application under test](https://ticket-box.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/index.html) uses Cypress to confirm the interactivity of the page is behaving as expected._

## Setup Requirements

* _**First, ensure you have Git, node and NPM installed on your computer.**_

* _Clone this repository._
* _Open your terminal._
* _Navigate to the directory (such as your Desktop) where you want the cloned project to reside._
* _Type `git clone https://github.com/webquiza/cypress.io-basics.git`._
* _Press Enter._
* _cd into the `cypress.io-basics` folder._
* _Open the project in your code editor._
* _In your terminal, run `$ npm install cypress --save-dev` to download Cypress as a dev dependency._
* _Run `$ npm cypress open` which will open Cypress in interactive mode for the first time._
* _Under the INTEGRATION TESTS drop down menu, click on the `tickets.spec.js` file. This will run the automated tests in interactive mode._
* _Or, you can run the tests in headless mode. To do so run, `$ npm test`. This will run the tests directly in your terminal._
